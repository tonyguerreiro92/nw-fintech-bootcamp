## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Payments & Remittances.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

The major impact innovation and from where all started was digitalizing banks, as each individual started having access to a smartphone and internet connection, this made it possible to start sending money via internet, and from this, everything started cascading out. Venmo for example, is not a bank, but it holds money for you and lets you receive and send money via digital app, and then send it to your bank. After this, important trends in the Point Of Sale area also started changing as the access to internet was better, now you can basically convert any smartphone into a point of sale for any business. Another important development is sending money between countries, now it's much easier than 10 years ago. Basically, thanks to the smartphone and internet access for everyone, any type of payment and remittance is now way easier.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

Square, Clover, Aloha, Micros, Touchbistro, Upserve, Lightspeed, CAKE, Venmo, Apple Pay, Android Pay, Zelle.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

It has homogenized payments in the restaurant industry. In my personal experience, I feel that when a restaurant has toast the payment will be simple and easy, and since the point of sales are the same, you don't have to understand how different machines work to read cards, it makes a much smoother experience for payemnts in restaurants.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

Since when a user pays at a restaurant using Toast, you now have his data including: email, name, food the user ordered, information of the card, you can nos start using data analytics and knowing what other restaurants the user goes to and what does the user orders there, so from that, you can analyze the data and start suggesting either new plates to restaurants, or new restaurants the user can go to that also have Toast, by this, the user can go to a new restaurant that has Toast and the user will enjoy it, and Toast will receive money because the user used Toast in the new restaurant.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

Because the more the user pays with Toast, the more money Toast gets, and also the more information Toast gets from the user.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

Python for Data Analytics, doing descriptive and predictive analysis, and when more data is collected, AI can be implemented so that it is an independent solution with no more human interaction.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

Because when you start analyzing the data from the user, you would need to know when a new restaurant implements Toast, or look for a restaurant that the user will like. With descriptive and predictive analysis, you can start suggesting the user where to go, and what plates the user will like in the suggested restaurant.
